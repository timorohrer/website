Consider the case of Bodie, California. In 1859 a group of prospectors came
upon gold in hills east of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. Initially only a
small mining camp was established since interest in the area was low, until in
1876 a tunnel caved in and revealed a promising vein of gold ore. Thousands of
"forty-niners" flocked to Bodie and just three years later the town had grown to a
population of 10,000.

Bodie was as thriving a boomtown as any of the era. The Standard Consolidated
Company built a stamp mill to extract the gold ore and from it radiated
businesses that enterprising men and woman had established. Saloons and Hotels,
Grocery Stores and Banks, Newspapers and Law firms, all quickly build to meet
the demands of ever increasing numbers. By some count more than 60 Saloons
lined the dirt roads, along with volunteer fire companies, unions, stables,
blacksmiths, and doctors. Bodie even had a thriving Chinatown with hundreds
of Chinese residents, along with temples and opium dens.

But as with any gold rush the resource depleted quickly. By the 1880's most
opportunistic miners had moved on to more promising lands and after the turn
of the century the large mines were closed. By 1915 Bodie was described as a
ghost town. Nowadays Bodie is preserved as a State Park and attracts many 
visitors every year.

All the business created by the mines vanished with the mines. When using the
three sector model of economics by Fisher, Clark, and Fourastie to analyze the
fate of Bodie, the mines were the primary sector, tasked with the extraction of
raw materials. The secondary sector, manufacturing, was the stamp mill which
further processed rock. All the other businesses in town were of the tertiary
sector, service. A Saloon could not survive if the population working in the
other sectors got up and left. In the case of a gold rush town we expect this
fragility, but do we see this phenomenon nowadays?

As a society transitions for an industrial to a post-industrial society, both
the primary and secondary sector shrink considerably. A quaternary sector,
dealing with intellectual activities such as scientific research and education
grows steadily.
